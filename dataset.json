        "description": "In the summer of 1914, Prokofiev, the then-emerging enfant terrible of Russian music, traveled to London to meet with the ballet impresario Sergei Diaghilev. Diaghilev commissioned the young composer to write a ballet with a prehistoric or fairy-tale scenario – hoping, perhaps, for the same kind of success he had recently enjoyed with the like-themed ballets of Stravinsky.\n\nThe composer settled on a theme centered on a prehistoric tribe of barbarians, the Scythians, known to drink blood and engage in other similarly gruesome practices. The immediate musical result was Ala and Lolli (1914-1915), which Prokofiev first presented to Diaghilev in the form of a nearly complete piano score. Diaghilev, however, rejected the work as too close in spirit to Stravinsky's Rite of Spring, fearing comparisons to the still-new succès du scandale. To placate Prokofiev, Diaghilev commissioned from the dejected composer a new ballet, Chout (1915). Before fulfulling that commission, though, Prokofiev turned his attention back to his orphaned ballet, distilling its most effective numbers into the Scythian Suite.\n\nThe suite is cast in four movements whose titles readily evoke the ballet's prehistoric themes: \"The Adoration of Veles and Ala,\" \"The Enemy God and Dance of the Spirits of Darkness,\" \"Night,\" and \"The Glorious Departure of Lolly and the Sun's Procession.\" What is most immediately striking about the score is Prokofiev's brilliant orchestration. The music is the product of a 23 year old, yet it clearly demonstrates the unmistakable confidence, control, and imagination of a seasoned master. The vivid colors and instrumental effects are such that the work, despite its relative unfamiliarity, survives as one of the most brilliant orchestral essays of its era.\n\nThe first movement begins savagely, the discordant main theme calling to mind a titanic struggle between monstrous forces. The mood turns quiet but restless, and the sound darkens; here the writing for reeds and harp here is especially brilliant and atmospheric. The second movement is fast and brutal, the rhythms pounding and insistent, the themes menacing and ominous; this is the most unambiguously Russian music of the suite. The first half of \"Night\" is appropriately dark, the second half explosive and unsettling. \"The Glorious Departure\" begins with a rush of energy, then slows to a colorful march, followed by a menacing yet comical theme. The suite concludes with a brilliant depiction of the rising sun (18:25).\n\nThe Scythian Suite premiered under the composer's baton in St. Petersburg on January 29, 1916.\n\n0:00 - The Adoration of Veles and Ala\n5:38 - The Enemy God and the Dance of the Spirits of Darkness\n8:49 - Night\n15:02 - The Glorious Departure of Lolly and the Procession of the Sun\n(The exact names of the movements may vary, as they are translations)\n\nPerformed by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, \nClaudio Abbado, conductor",

Ignacio Villa conocido tiempo después como Bola de Nieve (11/09/1911 - 02/10/1971), le debe su nombre artístico a su descubridora  la artista Rita Montaner, quien se hacía acompañar por Ignacio al piano, tanto en sus presentaciones en La Habana como en sus giras a México, país que lo acogió siempre y donde alcanzó notable popularidad, hasta el punto de convertirse en el lugar donde finalmente murió. \n\nBOLA DE NIEVE  le canta al AMOR, es un álbum descarnado donde el artista nos entrega unas interpretaciones con un solo de piano, una voz desgarradora y el corazón en carne viva, grabado muy probablemente a finales de los años 60’s. Resulta evidente su predilección por las obras de sus amigas y talentosas creadoras, María Grever (Alma mía, Ausencia, Ausencia, Ya no me quieres y Que dirías de mí), Chabuca Granda (La flor de la canela), Marta Valdés (Tú no sospechas), entre otras canciones de amor de la época. Una producción obligatoria para poder retener entre nosotros a este ángel negro de la música, conocido como Bola de Nieve convertido ya, en un mito para siempre y por siempre.\n\nProbably, he is one of the most brilliant musicians from the Caribbean island and a genuine icon of the Cuban idiosyncrasy. Ignacio Villa later known as Bola de Nieve (09/11/1911 - 10/02/1971) owes his stage name to its discoverer artist Rita Montaner, who was accompanied by Ignacio on the piano, in their presentations in La Habana and tours to Mexico, country that always received him and where he achieved remarkable popularity, to the point of becoming the place where he finally died. \n\nBola de Nieve sings to love, is a stark album where the artist gives us a few performances with a piano solo, wrenching voice and open heart, probably recorded in the late 60's. Clearly, his predilection for the works of their friends and creative talents, Maria Grever (Alma mía, Ausencia, Ausencia, Ya no me quieres y Que dirías de mí), Chabuca Granda (La flor de la canela), Marta Valdés (Tú no sospechas), among other love songs of the era.

        "description": "Franz Joseph Haydn:\nSymphony No. 60 in C major, Hob. I/60 \"Il distratto (The Distracted one)\" (with Score)\nComposed: 1774\nPerformance: Orpheus Chamber Orchestra\n\n00:00 1. Adagio – Allegro di molto (C major)\n06:02 2. Andante (G major)\n12:30 3. Menuetto (C major) – Trio (C minor)\n16:51 4. Presto (C minor – C major)\n19:49 5. Adagio (F major)\n23:46 6. Finale. Prestissimo (C major)\n\nAs a featured part of the regular round of theatrical performances put on at the Esterházy court, the Carl Wahr Troupe had a brief residency every summer from 1772 to 1777. The Troupe specialized in Shakespeare performances in German translation, but also presented various other plays. As part of their 1774 season, they presented the five act comedy Der Zerstreute (The Absent-Minded Man), a translation of Le Distrait by Jean François Regnard. For this play Franz Josef Haydn composed an overture and several additional pieces of incidental music. The play, and Haydn's music, were very well received; the newspaper Pressburger Zeitung reported: \"The connoisseurs are amazed on the one hand, whilst the rest of the public is simply enchanted. For Haydn knows how to satisfy both. From the most affected pompousness he drops into doggerel, and thus Haydn and Regnard vie with each other to see who can produce the most whimsical absentminded entertainment.\" At some point Haydn assembled this music into a symphony, which he titled in Italian, Il Distratto (The Distracted one).\n\nThe action of the play revolves around the absentmindedness of Leandre, whose forgetfulness gets him into all sorts of trouble. For this light-hearted farce Haydn created equally comical music; even in the more serious-minded (the first and fifth) of the symphony's six movements, the spirit of comedy is not far off. Here Haydn also made his most extensive use of folk songs in a symphony; such tunes can be found in movements 2, 3, 4 and 6.\n\nThe first movement is noteworthy for the several times the music gradually dies away, followed by a loud and abrupt return; these gestures are quite reminiscent of the \"surprise\" of Haydn's eponymous Symphony No. 94 of 1791. The gracious second movement employs a French folk song, and features fanfare-like interruptions from the winds. After the Menuetto comes the fourth movement, Presto, and its frantic sequence of Balkan folk melodies. For the fifth movement, titled Adagio (di Lamentatione), Haydn employs a melody that may have derived from Gregorian chant; gentle arpeggios in the strings accompany this lovely tune; after a brief fanfare, the melody returns.\n\nHaydn saves his broadest joke for the last movement, which bursts into action at a wild Prestissimo pace but grinds to an abrupt halt when the violins realize that their G strings are mistuned to F! They noisily retune, and then the music starts up again, flying forward brilliantly to the end.\n\nAll Music Guide\n(https://www.allmusic.com/composition/symphony-no-60-in-c-major-il-distratto-h-1-60-mc0002366733)\n\nWikipedia article\n(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symphony_No._60_(Haydn))\n\nHaydn107\n(https://www.haydn107.com/en/Sinfonien/60)\n\nInternational Music Score Library Project (IMSLP)\n(https://imslp.org/wiki/Symphony_No.60_in_C_major,_Hob.I:60_(Haydn,_Joseph))",

        "description": "André Messager: Isoline Ballet Suite (1888)\n\nOrchestre de Paris conducted by Jean-Pierre Jacquillat\n\nAndré Charles Prosper Messager (French: [mɛsaʒe]; 30 December 1853 – 24 February 1929) was a French composer, organist, pianist, conductor and administrator. His stage compositions included ballets and 30 opéra comiques and operettas, among which Véronique had lasting success, with Les p'tites Michu and Monsieur Beaucaire also enjoying international success.\nDespite financial obstacles, Messager pursued studies in piano and composition, with teachers including Camille Saint-Saëns and Gabriel Fauré. He became a major figure in the musical life of London as well as Paris, both as a conductor and a composer. Most of his Parisian works were produced in London, where several of them had long runs and numerous revivals, and he wrote two operatic works in English. He was the only French composer to write an original Savoy opera. Towards the end of his career, he composed musical comedies for Sacha Guitry and Yvonne Printemps.\n\nAs a conductor, Messager held prominent positions in Paris and London, at the head of the Opéra-Comique, the Paris Opéra, the Orchestre de la Société des Concerts du Conservatoire, and of the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden. Although as a composer he is known chiefly for his light works, as a conductor he presented a wide range of operas, from Mozart to Richard Strauss, and he acquired a reputation as a conductor of Wagner. In Paris he conducted the world premieres of Debussy's Pelléas et Mélisande, Massenet's Grisélidis and Charpentier's Louise. At Covent Garden, he gave the British premieres of operas by Saint-Saëns and Massenet. (Ref: Wikipedia)\n\nIsoline is an opera, described as a 'conte de fées' (fairy story) in three acts and ten tableaux, on a text by Catulle Mendès, with music by André Messager (1888, Paris)\n\nIn mid-1888 Catulle Mendès had promised the libretto of Isoline to Chabrier but according to the writer, the Théâtre de la Renaissance wanted Messager to write the music, as he was better known for writing operettas and Chabrier had \"too much talent, a talent too epic and grand\".\n\nMessager had already composed incidental music for Le petit Poucet, a 'féérie' staged at the Théâtre de la Gaîté in 1885. Messager probably wrote some of the score at Montivillers, near to Le Havre; in order to complete the orchestration in time, he was assisted by Paul Lacome, a composer and friend of Chabrier. Just after the première, the theatre started heading towards bankruptcy, although nearly 60 performances took place up to mid February (with the conductor Paul Letombe). (Ref: Wikipedia)",
