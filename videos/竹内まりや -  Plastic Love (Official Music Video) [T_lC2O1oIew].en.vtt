00:00:40.451 --> 00:00:48.427
With a sudden kiss and a passionate gaze, 

00:00:50.024 --> 00:00:57.334
do not cause a malfunction to the love program 

00:00:58.011 --> 00:01:06.465
Type in encounters and separations well

00:01:07.261 --> 00:01:12.062
When the time comes, it ends

00:01:12.661 --> 00:01:15.111
Don’t hurry!

00:01:18.258 --> 00:01:21.723
Since the day I was heartbroken, 

00:01:22.793 --> 00:01:27.000
I’ve been having a life 

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:35.192
that’s been reversed between day and night

00:01:35.524 --> 00:01:43.911
While dancing the nights away at the popular disco, 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:49.819
there is a magic I’ve learned

00:01:50.172 --> 00:01:52.172
I’m sorry!　

00:01:55.793 --> 00:02:04.515
Never love me seriously

00:02:04.808 --> 00:02:09.292
Love is just a game

00:02:09.674 --> 00:02:13.949
All I need is to have fun with it 

00:02:14.025 --> 00:02:23.182
The showy dresses and shoes decorating my closed heart 
 

00:02:23.497 --> 00:02:28.414
are my lonely friends

00:02:49.704 --> 00:02:54.120
The men who flirt with me are 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:03:03.984
ironically always similar to him for some reason 

00:03:04.022 --> 00:03:08.502
My memories with him are overlapped

00:03:08.502 --> 00:03:23.352
Don’t ask me why even if I drop my glass and suddenly glisten with tears

00:03:25.376 --> 00:03:34.378
When I fall asleep by the highway at dawn,

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:42.785
Only halogen lights are mysteriously shining

00:03:43.111 --> 00:03:57.137
Although somebody is whispering that I’m an icy cold woman, 

00:03:57.203 --> 00:03:59.203
don’t worry

00:04:02.876 --> 00:04:11.820
I’m just playing games, I know that’s plastic love

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:21.429
Dance to the plastic beat, Another morning comes

00:04:21.604 --> 00:04:30.491
I’m just playing games, I know that’s plastic love

00:04:31.008 --> 00:04:39.687
Dance to the plastic beat, Another morning comes

00:04:40.113 --> 00:04:49.469
I’m just playing games, I know that’s plastic love

00:04:49.822 --> 00:04:57.779
Dance to the plastic beat, Another morning comes
