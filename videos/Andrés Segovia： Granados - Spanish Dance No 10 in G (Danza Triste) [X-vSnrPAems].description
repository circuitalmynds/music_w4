Enrique Granados - Spanish Dance No. 10 in G (Danza Triste)

At a time when the guitar occupied a marginal space within the classical music of the 20th century, the guitarist Andrés Segovia gave an instrumental hierarchy to the Spanish guitar working on transcriptions of classical or baroque works and collaborating closely with composers such as Torroba to help them compose classical music for guitar; composers who would later be called "compositores Segovianos" such as Federico Moreno Torroba, Ponce, Falla, Tansman or Villa-lobos, among others.
